I have no idea why it stopped working. I have a video of it working and i haven't touched it since 2016. But now it's all broken for some reason.

As far as i remember, it used javafx and Java 7. Though it has a LOT of bugs for some reason. Like, lighting doesn't work properly, sprites don't work properly, so, a lot of stuff. 

So you may observe cringe code or try to fix it. Maybe i will fix it, though i don't really want.
